# Semantic Search App

This is a Streamlit application for semantic search of medical images.

## Project Description

This application allows users to perform semantic search on medical images.
It is built using Streamlit and leverages libraries for medical image processing and visualization.


## Getting Started

To run the application, ensure you have installed the dependencies using uv:

```bash
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Alternatively, you can use pip if uv is not available:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the Streamlit application:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Ensure that you have an `app.py` file in the `semantic-search-app` directory which contains the Streamlit application code.
